What makes a leader

Andrew Chen Wang 31 Oct Sat 2020 Just finished writing my response in SimpleJWT about NOT changing the name blacklist to anything else. But I fell into me talking to myself again and came up with this.

To be weak is to be open minded. To be strong is to be a leader, close minded, and make the decisions. I fear that if I were to be elected president, I would become close minded, as I should, to stick to a plan.

But when you are weak you become more knowledgable. It is when you become a leader, you must trace back to your weak points and take advantage of the knowledge and wisdom you gained to pursue your role as a leader and be strong.

This quote is aligned with “learn from your mistakes” but in the form of being a leader.
