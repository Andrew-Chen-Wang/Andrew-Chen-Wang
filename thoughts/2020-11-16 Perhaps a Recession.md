# 2020-11-16: Perhaps a Recession

I firmly believe there will be a recession, not necessarily a depression (as of yet)
in the United States that will have a ripple effect around the world in the beginning
of 2021. All because of loans.

Disclaimer: I'm not an economist, but I believe that there may be an issue 
in the current November 16 economic context. Now, the following is just me
blabbering. I have no idea what I'm talking about:

1. I was talking to a ~~XXXXXXXXXXX~~ manager in a recent hackathon,
and he predicted that it would happen in January due to several banking jobs being
cut in the industry. That was the first sign, with warrant, that a recession
could happen; to me, that meant low credit flow in the US might happen. As of yet,
Washington has been making all of thes risky loans, possibly worse than
the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

2. This is in addition to the recent burst in tech stocks (I would even include
Tesla because of their heavy reliance on marketing on their features). A panic
is something that could also drop the market. Luckily, I'm hearing people
selling furniture already, but I worry there's going to be too much overspending
at the moment that could lead to a recession, almost a second/third Dot Com bubble.
It's actually kinda out of control, overspeculated, and, although fair that technology
is being adopted, the model of MVP and quick first-time user adoption may be the
huge downfall of this overspeculation.

3. The unemployment rate with the constant cash aid by Congress is helping the
population; like the aftermath of the '08 recession, Paulson, Bernenke, and Geithner
made sure the root of the problem was fixed via capital injection into the financial
institutions, and Obama and Geithner making sure the population got aid during
the natural recovery period (ambiguous aid). I think the problem is we're missing
step one: what going on with the banking system? How many banks are actually giving
out loans at the moment? Too many risky loans or too little, you'll have a recession
either from missing or lack of moving capital.

4. The Fed hasn't been doing much except for decreasing interest rates, per usual
during recessions. But one factor that I see concern is the aforementioned ambiguous
aid provided by yours truly. Bonds are still at a steady pace (in all measurements e.g. 
price), but how much is too much such that there is too minimal of minimum return.
This isn't like the Great Depression; no one's outside finding work today.
Everyone's inside not doing much (including productivity of those still employed).
The only thing that the two are similar in is the amount of free aid like more
lines for soup.

I think we'll have a small recession, but I'm weary as to how large this'll become.
