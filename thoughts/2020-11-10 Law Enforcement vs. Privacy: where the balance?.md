# Law Enforcement vs. Privacy: where the balance?

I remember -- back in 2016(?) -- watching a Verge (?) video claiming the new ML or surveilance (can't remember)
system that LA county had implemented was "racist" and had large implications of "invasion of privacy."

Something notable to think about is China's current surveilance system or the NSA's leaked system.
The current option is something like the LAPD: continuously surveil notorious regions to deter
any potential crime popping up. China is a prime example in that the evidence is clear anywhere
and everywhere you go and do some action. China and the NSA also has something in common: collecting
evidence via your online precense and devices. These options adapt to the new technology arising,
from what people use to how they can take advantage of the same innovations.

I disagree with these options of deterring crime. Crime and corruption will live and thrive in human
history and psychology. In other words, it will never go away. Something that can be invested more
is making sure George W. Bush's [No Child Left Behind Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act)
is re-evaluated so that cities like Detroit don't have to close public schools because there isn't
enough resources (not necessarily money but also time from the teachers or tutors helping students
overtime). This is an important topic especially during the Black Lives Matter protest that wants
to defund police departments and increase education funding: the problem is is money going to fix
that problem?

To me, the solution is educational AND cultural reform. For example, lots of kids in poor 
neighborhoods don't have a father figure, only a single mother. If the US were to focus
more on family education or dynamics (e.g. through social events) or if religions want to
make a "Third Great Awakening" to boost some kind of moral dillema or ethical teachings (I have
a firm belief that all religions teach pracitcally the same things, morally and ethically,
and a friend of mine who's gone to church for decades even admits that, even providing
a story about how floods are in almost every religion as a secondary piece of justification).

## Pro

Climate change is actually paralleled to the current option: adaptation vs. mitigation.
I'm proposing education and a culture change needs to happen. Adding more cameras, surveilance
systems, data mining, etc. is adaptation. My solution is an act of mitigation -- preventing future
crimes without needing to invade people's prviacy.

John F. Kennedy once said "We are going to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard."
For politicians, they should be implementing solutions for a culture and education change.
Currently, politicians are going the lazy, easy route by helping these kinds of surveillance system
beÂ implemented. Either that, or they do nothing, have no solution, or no one can think of something
better or have presented anything better.

I've given some solutions above like religious awakenings, schools teaching children about parenthood,
having BOTH parents (for crying out loud) acting as mature figures or simply being parent figures,
more sense of community (e.g. basketball is great and all; why not make some cross town friendly
competitions of U-10 through U-18? Football is also great; nothing against them. We don't need to
integrate lots of poor people from de-industrialized cities likes Baltimore coming to suburbs and
expect them to make the same money; they won't. They don't have the skills to compete or keep up
with the taxes).

Note: regarding religious awakenings, society has naturally become very much more secular. I'm not
encouraging everyone take up a religion (I've had lots of time just thinking about religion for
awhile... yeah for being an introvert!), but I want to make a point that it's possible even under
our current public shcool teaching without needing to change the curriculum:

Curiously, one of my biology teachers teaching bacteriology quit teaching to become a nun; another 
one made sure to explain evolution and natural selection (something still not taught in every 
Southern USA public school TO THIS DAY) is still *theory* but you know it's true because of bacteria
being killers of people. She just made sure to say humans could have also just been here for millenias.

## Con

One issue I have with this is actually related to a recent issue in SimpleJWT: [Rename Blacklist app](https://github.com/SimpleJWT/django-rest-framework-simplejwt/issues/322).
I take huge concern over people trying to narrow people's vocabulary (the most notable point being
many programmers usually just read code or documentation for their work life, whereas students get
a huge variety of language).

This is the same with culture. I fear that, whatever the culture change may be, whether that's to
implement some kind of parenthood education in high school or college or trying to make more
social events happen around the country for families, it may have weird effects that I can't
possibly imagine.

You can think of it as the Christian trend. Most Christians start off fairly poor. As someone who
climbs up the socioeconomic ladder, there may be less time to go to church or other reasons; if
anything, there is a niche trend of increasing socioeconomic standing being correlated to a
proportionally less number of people being Christians -- or simply not participating as much
as before in practice (not necessarily church).

Humans are humans; I don't know whose family is going to be stable or not. It could be based on
psychological evaluations or how someone was raised in the household (I did a recidivism paper
in 10th grade, and it's kind of insane thinking about how much that effects children not having
a parent figure of maturity).

### Misc. Notes

An argument I just came up with is how police need a warrant to search your house; searching
someone's device and online information should also have some kind of warrant -- to an extent
it does happen. A prime example is the police asking Google for a person's email. But internet
culture is based on anonymity, creating double personas, lack of fear for retribution. This internet
culture is what I've tried to change with Velnota (i.e. thinking is important).
