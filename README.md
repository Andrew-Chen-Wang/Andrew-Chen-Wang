### Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew

Stuff I wanna do on this account: https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/TODO Some are decent ideas that
are nice cash cows, but they're ideas that I don't have time for... so they're public domain :)

Monthly quotes I make (view README comments for my past quotes):

> You can be 100% successful building but fail at the end -- not because you failed, but because you made a mistake.

<sup>explanation in comments in README</sup>

<!--
1. Don't hold grudges. Let 'em go. Focus on what you love, not hate.
<sup>My small motto that someone said was pretty nice.</sup>
2. You don't convince others by being their nemesis but instead by being their friend.
3. You can be 100% successful building but fail at the end -- not because you failed, but because you made a mistake. - Wednesday 30 Sep 2020. (Just for explanation: think about a very competitive market. You can continue to increase your sales in every decision you make, which is a success. But whether it's right or wrong is different. You made the wrong decision in that your competitors made more sales than you. That was your mistake. Maybe 2/3 options led to success, and you chose the one that increased your sales account tremendously. But your competitor chose that other successful option. Knowing the difference between success-failure and correctness is important to me.

I'm looking to help with whatever I can;
this is my public GitHub account where I host personal,
public projects and WIP hobbies.

I've had a lot of fun learning web + mobile applications, security, ML,
DevOps, databases, and caches in the past few months on this account.
I play a lot with Django and am currently trying to pioneer native
Django for websockets through [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django).
I also help to maintain [django-cachalot](https://github.com/noripyt/django-cachalot)
and [SimpleJWT](https://github.com/SimpleJWT/django-rest-framework-simplejwt).

<!--
Hehe thanks for taking a look here. This is what it used to say:

Regarding the social issues of today, I do my best to
contribute to solutions. In the past, those
came anonymously through my pseudonyms. I'd like
to make *some* of them more public.

> If there are problems, a solution will come.
Not because they'll rain down, but because diligence rises.
