### Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew

I'm looking to help with whatever I can;
This is my public GitHub account where I host personal,
public projects and WIP hobbies.

I've had a lot of fun learning web + mobile applications, security, ML,
DevOps, databases, and caches in the past few months on this account.
I play a lot with Django and am currently trying to pioneer native
Django for websockets through [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django).
I also help to maintain [django-cachalot](https://github.com/noripyt/django-cachalot)
and [SimpleJWT](https://github.com/SimpleJWT/django-rest-framework-simplejwt).

Regarding the social issues of today, I do my best to
contribute to solutions. In the past, those
came anonymously through my pseudonyms. I'd like
to make *some* of them more public.

> If there are problems, a solution will come.
Not because they'll rain down, but because diligence rises.

Current **public** projects:
- [Donate Anything](https://github.com/Donate-Anything) (search up items you'd like to donate and we'll suggest how to handle it)
- [Natural Gravity Engine](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/natural-gravity-engine) (physics engine that allows researching into the natural properties of gravity and gravitational waves without programming them)

Stuff I wanna do on this account: https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/TODO
