### Hey üëã I'm Andrew

Stuff I wanna do on this account can be found at [Velnota](https://velnota.com/) and [my TODO repo](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/TODO).

  <summary>About Me</summary>

I run [Velnota](https://velnota.com) and [Donate Anything](https://donate-anything.org/), a social media site about creating ideas and expanding upon them and a donation/recycling online service for the sake of laziness.

I'm looking to help with whatever I can;
this is my public GitHub account where I host personal,
public projects and WIP hobbies.

I've had a lot of fun learning web + mobile applications, security, ML,
DevOps, databases, and caches in the past few months on this account.
I play a lot with Django and am currently trying to pioneer native
Django for websockets through [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django).
I also help to maintain [django-cachalot](https://github.com/noripyt/django-cachalot)
and [SimpleJWT](https://github.com/SimpleJWT/django-rest-framework-simplejwt).

  <summary>Old Quotes</summary>
  
1. Don't hold grudges. Let 'em go. Focus on what you love, not hate.
<sup>My small motto that someone said was pretty nice.</sup>
2. You don't convince others by being their nemesis but instead by being their friend.
3. You can be 100% successful building but fail at the end -- not because you failed, but because you made a mistake. - Wednesday 30 Sep 2020. (Just for explanation: think about a very competitive market. You can continue to increase your sales in every decision you make, which is a success. But whether it's right or wrong is different. You made the wrong decision in that your competitors made more sales than you. That was your mistake. Maybe 2/3 options led to success, and you chose the one that increased your sales account tremendously. But your competitor chose that other successful option. Knowing the difference between success-failure and correctness is important to me.
4. What makes a leader
Andrew Chen Wang 31 Oct Sat 2020 Just finished writing my response in SimpleJWT about NOT changing the name blacklist to anything else. But I fell into me talking to myself again and came up with this.
To be weak is to be open minded. To be strong is to be a leader, close minded, and make the decisions. I fear that if I were to be elected president, I would become close minded, as I should, to stick to a plan.
But when you are weak you become more knowledgable. It is when you become a leader, you must trace back to your weak points and take advantage of the knowledge and wisdom you gained to pursue your role as a leader and be strong.
This quote is aligned with ‚Äúlearn from your mistakes‚Äù but in the form of being a leader.
5. Being a listener is being drunk. I.e. creativity at its finest, but don't actually get drunk. I've never, no one should; bad stuff happens.
6. It's only useful if it's a toy. It's something I learned from Freeman Dyson, but he's not wrong (albeit controvercial as a person). He talked about computers and biotech, but honestly lots of things do work when people fool around with it a lot like ML and... clothes? Wtf I mean sure, people like trying on clothes to make sure they look good...?
7. It's okay if u don't like me not everyone has good taste ~ Sophia Liang She's cooler than the sun and hotter than the moon) <!-- We're not dating, but... DO NOT EVER call your friend AVERAGE -\->
8. Entrepreneurs are different from you and your corporate beasts. You don't have to believe in me, just the idea, the vision. I've had to constantly wear glasses to give me vision; I had to keep purchasing them as my vision kept deteriorating. But I'm able to wear these glasses because I can afford them, and will continue to be able to afford them. Trust in the idea... Give it your trust. If not, I recommend you purchase some glasses. All of you.
9. Be a balanced idealist. Similar to point 8: you can have your ideals, but understand that they are ideal under certain circumstances. Don't let ideals get in the way of progress.
10. If you try to stick a toothpick into a saber-toothed tiger's eye, you not only have a lollipop but also a time machine. (I've got nothing to say this month :P). This breed is extinct, but my point is there is nothing. I'm not sure why saber-toothed tiger popped in my head; I just heard it throughout my life in various settings e.g. a YouTube video where gamers spew random words. Idk. But yea that's all I got.
11. If only I could see skin color. Oh well. (I hate the news... That should be a good enough explanation for most Americans)
12. 5 locks is the same as 1 against a roommate. They'll still break in.
13. Post-encouragement discouragement is futile. It's based on a paper I've always wanted to write about which is it is actually easier to discourage than to encourage, at least when the victim is already in a habitual state like a user of harmful drugs. More details are in my TODO repo. But essentially, yes, humans are lazy, and that's why we say encouragement is difficult. But when humans are acclimated to a habit, it is difficult to get them out of that state.

Hehe thanks for taking a look here. This is what it used to say:

Regarding the social issues of today, I do my best to
contribute to solutions. In the past, those
came anonymously through my pseudonyms. I'd like
to make *some* of them more public.

> If there are problems, a solution will come.
Not because they'll rain down, but because diligence rises.
